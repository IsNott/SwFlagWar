# 'None' is a special rarity that is used to indicate that an item has no rarity.
# If an item has this rarity, then nothing will be added to the lore.
# Useful if default rarities are displayed, and you want to exclude an item from that.
# Additionally useful in item lookup: you can do rarity:none to prevent the rarity from being displayed.

weight: 100 # Uses a higher weight to ensure that it is not overridden by other rarities
